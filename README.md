# countdown-app

TODO
[ ] better define my types with actual properties
[ ] look at TS example to reduce the # of action imports
[ ] notifications (enum and state created)
[ ] need action to clear notification state, also remember auto clear (timeout)
[ ] will I need to remove error from fetch_[]_errors?
[ ] check if i'm using enums correctly in userReducer.ts
[ ] should I be fetching the list again or just updating the data? probably just fetch the list
[ ] if we update a deadline on the single page, take the user back to /deadlines or swipe to next deadline...?
[ ] maybe add some sort of trigger that indicates to update single deadline if we're on the single deadline view?
